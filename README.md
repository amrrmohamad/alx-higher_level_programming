## 🧑‍💻 Overview

Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and power, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced developers. This repository will guide you through Python’s core features, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of Python fundamentals and will be well-prepared for more advanced topics.

## ✨ Features

This repository includes examples and explanations for the following topics:

- **Basic Syntax**: Understanding Python's clean, readable syntax and structure.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Working with different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- **Control Flow**: Implementing decision-making with `if`, `elif`, and `else`, as well as looping constructs like `for` and `while`.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code with function definitions, parameters, and return values.
- **Data Structures**: Mastering built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applying OOP principles like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files for persistent storage.
- **Error and Exception Handling**: Writing robust code with `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- **Modules and Packages**: Organizing code and reusing libraries with Python's modular system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify your installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```
